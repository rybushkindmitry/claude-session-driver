# claude-session-driver

Turn one Claude Code session into a project manager that delegates tasks to other Claude Code sessions.

## Why

A single Claude session works on one task at a time. With this plugin, a controller session launches worker sessions in tmux, assigns each a task, monitors their progress, reviews their tool calls, and collects results. Workers run in parallel. The controller decides what to do with their output.

## How It Works

Each worker session loads hooks that write lifecycle events to a JSONL file: session start, prompt submitted, tool use, stop, and session end. A PreToolUse hook pauses before every tool call, giving the controller a window to approve or deny it. If the controller does not respond within the timeout, the tool call proceeds.

The controller orchestrates workers through shell scripts that manage tmux sessions, poll events, read conversation logs, and clean up.

## Installation

```bash
claude /install claude-session-driver@superpowers-marketplace
```

Requires **tmux**, **jq**, and the **claude** CLI.

## Usage

Install the plugin and ask Claude to manage a project. The `driving-claude-code-sessions` skill provides orchestration patterns:

- **Delegate and wait:** Launch a worker, assign a task, read the result.
- **Fan out:** Launch several workers on independent tasks, wait for all to finish.
- **Pipeline:** Chain workers so each builds on the previous worker's output.
- **Supervise:** Hold a multi-turn conversation with a worker, reviewing each response.
- **Hand off:** Pass a running worker session to a human operator in tmux.

## Remote Workers

Workers can run on remote SSH hosts or inside Docker containers, not just locally.

```bash
# SSH worker — code lives on a remote machine
launch-worker.sh --name integration-tests \
  --target ssh://deploy@staging.example.com \
  --workdir /opt/app

# Docker worker — isolated environment using an existing container
launch-worker.sh --name node18-compat \
  --target docker://test-env \
  --workdir /app

# Ephemeral Docker worker — created on launch, removed on stop
launch-worker.sh --name ephemeral \
  --target docker-run://node:18 \
  --workdir /workspace
```

Hooks are synced automatically to the remote host via `scp` or `docker cp` on first launch. Prerequisites on the remote: `tmux`, `jq`, and `claude` CLI installed and authenticated.

All orchestration patterns work identically with remote workers.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `launch-worker.sh` | Start a worker session (locally or remote via `--target`) |
| `converse.sh` | Send a prompt, wait, return the response |
| `send-prompt.sh` | Send a prompt without waiting |
| `wait-for-event.sh` | Block until a lifecycle event appears |
| `read-events.sh` | Read and filter the event stream |
| `read-turn.sh` | Format the last turn as markdown |
| `stop-worker.sh` | Stop a worker and clean up |
| `approve-tool.sh` | Approve or deny a pending tool call |
